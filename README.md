# Anomalous polyA RT

This is a companion GitHub repository to the Kladwang et al. (2020) Biochemistry paper entitled "Anomalous reverse transcription through chemical modifications in polyadenosine stretches."

## polyA length and indel analysis
### `polyA_indel_analysis/TOD_MapSeq_S1S7`
Analysis of the length of polyA stretches as read out by sequencing. The raw count tables can be found in the `tables` folder, and plots generated by the Jupyter Notebook can be found in the `plots` folder. [The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code and explanations can be found here.](https://github.com/DasLab/Anomalous_polyA_RT/blob/master/polyA_indel_analysis/TOD_MapSeq_S1S7/polyA_lengths.ipynb)

### `polyA_indel_analysis/TOD_synthetic`
Analysis of the length of polyA stretches as ready out by sequencing for the chemically synthesized methylated TOD-S1 molecules. The raw count tables can be found in the `tables` folder, and plots generated by the Jupyter Notebook can be found in the `plots` folder. [The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code and explanations can be found here.](https://github.com/DasLab/Anomalous_polyA_RT/blob/master/polyA_indel_analysis/TOD_synthetic/TOD_syn_polyAlengths.ipynb)

### `polyA_indel_analysis/HIV_3UTR`
Analysis of the length of polyA stretches as ready out by sequencing for the HIV 3' UTR (including the 20 As included at the 3' end of the sequence). Raw count tables and plotted counts are available in the root of the folder. [The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code and explanations can be found here.](https://github.com/DasLab/Anomalous_polyA_RT/blob/master/polyA_indel_analysis/HIV_3UTR/HIV_polyA_raw_indel_analysis.ipynb)

## Comparison of reactivities
The `reactivity_calculations` directory contains the scripts used to calculate reactivities using the RNAFramework, ShapeMapper, and ShapeMapper2 tools. A comprehensive text file documenting the command line commands and flags used for running each tool can be found [here](https://github.com/DasLab/Anomalous_polyA_RT/blob/master/reactivity_calculations/reactivity_commandline_README.txt). [The Jupyter Notebook containing the plotting scripts can be found here.](https://github.com/DasLab/Anomalous_polyA_RT/blob/master/reactivity_calculations/plot_reactivity.ipynb)

## HIV 3' UTR M2-seq
The `HIV_m2seq_analysis` directory contains the output of the [M2-seq pipeline](https://github.com/ribokit/m2seq) when run on the sequencing data for *in vitro* transcribed HIV 3' UTR (both with and without a 3' polyA sequence).

## MATLAB scripts for capillary electrophoresis data
The `CE_analysis_matlab` folder contains a variety of scripts that were used to analyze capillary electrophoresis (CE) data and generate many of the CE-based figures in the paper. The `output` folder contains output figures from these scripts.

## Additional Data Downloads
* Raw sequencing data can be found in GEO at [GSE 149061](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149061) and a Stanford Data Repository [persistent URL](https://purl.stanford.edu/xm553fz5401). 
* Additional MATLAB analysis scripts and paper figures are compiled in a [DropBox archive](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/re2py0pfvyr0h0p/AACjQ_Otw-pKC34k6r2exYSZa?dl=0). 
* Capillary electrophoresis data are also archived at the [RNA Mapping Database](https://rmdb.stanford.edu/search/?sstring=polyA)
